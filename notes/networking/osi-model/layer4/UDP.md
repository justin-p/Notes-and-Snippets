# UDP

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the 'Internet protocol suite'.

With UDP computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams,to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels or data paths. UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms.  

UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection, like there is with TCP.
